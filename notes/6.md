### IBL Shadowing

#### Different Perspetives

**A many-light problem**? (cost linearly to nLights)

**A sampling problem**? 
1 to figure out an arbitrarily complex visibility $V(w_i)$; 
2 $V$ needs to be extracted from $L_o=\int_\Omega
^+ fL_iV\cos\theta_i dw_i$ ? ($V$ may not satisfy the accurate condition of the approximation!)

#### Solutions

**Industrial Solution (a compromise)**:
Generate one (or more) shadows from the brightest light sources (e.g. the sun)

#### Preliminaries

**Convolutions**
Filtering: the minimum frequency of $f$ and $g$ is reserved.
$$
h(x)=\int f(t)g(x-t)dt
$$
**Basis Functions** and **Reconstruction**
$$
f(x) = \sum_i c_i\cdot B_i(x)
$$
**Orthogonal** Basis Functions
$$
\int B_m(x)B_n(x)dx = 
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{for m!=n} \\
c, & \text{for m =n}
\end{cases}
$$
**Projection** to Orthogonal Functions
$$
c_i = \int_\Omega f(w)B_i(w)dw
$$
We can do Monte Carlo integration to get $c_i$.

#### Spherical Harmonics

All details see the supplement material: [SH Lighting: The Gritty Details](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~uffe/xjobb/Readings/GlobalIllumination/Spherical%20Harmonic%20Lighting%20-%20the%20gritty%20details.pdf)

Q: *Why SH instead of 2D Fourier Transform?*
A: *(I don't know  ヽ(。>д<)ｐ) Guess: is it because low-order Fourier Transform is hard to represent the high frequency changes nearing the edges of 2D images? But why don't use cube map instead?* 

##### **Rotating SH Functions**
If we wanted to rotate the projected function $\tilde{f}(x)\to R(\tilde{f})(x)$, we can rotate all it's SH basis functions then reconstruct it. 

A rotated SH basis function $R(B_i)(x)$ can be representated as <u>a linear combination of the SH basis functions at the same order</u>. Thus we can get the $R(\tilde{f}(x))$ projected at once, without do the sampling (i.e. integration with basis functions) again.

More over, the SH functions are *rotationally invariant*, i.e. rotate before SH projecting a function is the same as directly rotate the projected function. 
Specifically, if we rotate the original funtion $f(x)\to g(x)=R(f)(x)$ then SH project it to $\tilde g(x)$, we will get $\tilde{g}(x)=R(\tilde{f})(x)$.

#### Example: Diffuse IBL using SH?

Diffuse BRDF is smooth (low-frequency), so <u>it acts like a low pass filter</u> (when do dot product on frequency domain or convolution on spatial domain).

Thus when integrating diffuse BRDF with radiance: the resulting function value is always smooth (in convolution only the lowest frequency of the two functions is reserved).

Thus we don't need a high-order SH to describe environment lighting when being integrated with a diffuse BRDF. (*3 order SH IBL has $\leq 3\%$ RMS Error*)

SH IBL in RTR (without texture, SH order $\leq 3$): $E(n) = n^TMn$

#### SH IBL with Shadows

Solving the triple-product integration: (3 cubemap / equirectangular images)
$$
L(o)=\int_{\Omega} L(i)V(i)f(i,o)\max(0, n\cdot i)di
$$
The **two-part** rendering equation perspective:
Lighting: $L(i)$
Light transport: $T(p)=V(i)f(i,o)(n\cdot i)$

**Assumption:** 
Static scene(the light transport part), dynamic lighting (each environment map needs to be pre-computed) (rotating envmap $L$ can be performed once)

##### Basic Steps:

**Precompute**: project *each lighting* and *light transport* to SH basis space, usually we compute a SH vector for each vertex. At runtime, we can interpolate the shading or the SH vector for every point within the triangle.

**Runtime**: 
Diffuse case: constant BRDF 
$$
\begin{align}
L(o) & = \rho\int_{\Omega}L(i)V(i)\max(0, n\cdot i)di &\\
& \approx \rho \int_{\Omega} \sum(l_iB_i)\sum(T_iB_i)di  &\text{ (project two parts) }\\
& \approx \rho \sum l_i T_i &\text{ (the orthogonal property)}
\end{align}
$$
Glossy case: leave to next class...
