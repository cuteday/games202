### Deeper look into PCF

**Convolutional Weighted Filtering in PCF:**
$$
V(x) = \sum_{q\in \mathcal{N}(p)} w(p,q)\cdot \chi^+[D_{SM}-D_{scene}(x)]
$$
**Optimization Bottleneck:**
Averaging every texel inside the filter region (ave. blocker depth and visibility, step 1 and 3 in PCSS)
Solution: sampling, cons: noisy (temporal effect: *flickering*)

### Variance Soft Shadow Mapping, VSM

Faster, and more rough version of PCSS?

Motivation: the slow performance of <u>PCSS at step 3</u>
Idea: use CDF of  Normal Distribution to approximate depth distribution
Key: Fast computation of mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$

#### **Solution:** 
Mean: Hardware MIPMAPing / Summed Area Tables, ***SAT***
Variance: (get $x^2$ through render-to-texture: multi-output, while generating $x$)
$$
\text{Var}(x) = E(x^2) - E^2(x)
$$
CDF of Gaussian PDF: Error Function, ERF (numerical, not analytical solution)

**One more step:** 
Chebyshev's Inequality, instead of Gaussian CDF
$$
P(x\geq t) \leq \frac{ \sigma^2}{\sigma^2 + (t-\mu)^2} \text{, for }t > \mu
$$
**The Remaining Issue:** <u>PCSS Step 1</u>
Averaging the blocker depth $z_{occ}, \text{where } z_{occ}<t$ in filtering region
Avaliable: $E(z)$ through MIPMAP, $P(\text{unocc}|z)=P(z>t)$ through Chebyshev
Assumption: all $z_{unocc}=t$ (assumes surface parallel to light?)
Anormalies caused by this assumption:  *light leaking*

#### Mean Calculation for arbitrary rectangular: Range Query

**MIPMAP**
Only for square, needs interpolation

**SAT**
Preprocess: prefix sum (with Inclusion-Exclusion Principle in 2D)
Parallelization: 2-pass, first row then column (multiple 1-D prefix-sum each row/column)

### Moment Shadow Mapping

Motivation: more accurate distribution for VSSM using *higher moments*

**Moments** and orders:
first $m$ orders of moments represents a function (CDF here!) with $m/2$ steps.
 $\text{order} = 4$ is fine, optimize time cost with packing&unpacking (SIMD?)
