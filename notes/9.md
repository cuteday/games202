### Screen Space Directional Occlusion

Use direct lighting information, from rendering of screen space. (Instead of RSM, reflective shadow maps)

**3D Space Method**: At shading point $p$, shoot a random ray:
	-> hit obstacle: indirect illuminated
	-> no hit: no indirect illumination

The <u>inverted version</u> of SSAO! (shade color when no ambient lightingin SSAO)
**Insight**: SSAO assumes indirect lighting comes from distant surfaces, while SSDO assume it from nearby surfaces.
$$
\begin{align}
L_o^{\text{ind}}(p,\omega_o) & =\int_{\Omega^+,V=0}L_i^{\text{ind}}(p,\omega_i)
f_r(p,\omega_i,\omega_o)\cos\theta_i\,\mathrm{d}\omega_i \\
& =\int_{A_{Patch},V=0}L_i^{\text{ind}}(q\to p)V(p\leftrightarrow q)f(p, q\to p, w_o)\frac{\cos\theta_q \cos\theta_p}{\Vert p-q\Vert}dA
\end{align}
$$

**Steps**:
For each shading point $p$, sample points in the upper sphere near $p$.
For a sampled point $q$, visibility $V(p\leftrightarrow q)$ is approximated with $V_{\text{cam}}(q)$.

**Cons**:
Short ranged GI
Limited to screen space
Visibility is approxinated

### Screen Space Reflection

**Method**: Screen space ray marching using normals and depth buffer!

**Implementation details**:
At each step $p_i$ along a ray, check $p$'s depth and depth buffer, until finds an intersection
Step size: trade off between quality and computational costs
Glossy surfaces? trace a lobe according to BRDF(use *importance sampling*) 

**Adaptive step size**: 
Depth mipmap using <u>mean pooling</u> (instead of average)
Using the consecutive property of a node's children. (similar to BVH or a binary search tree)

**Details**: [Stochastic SSR](https://www.ea.com/frostbite/news/stochastic-screen-space-reflections)

**Cons**: Limited to screen space (hidden geometry, edge cutting, etc.)
