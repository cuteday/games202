### PRT Recap

#### PRT in Glossy Reflection

The light transpart in glossy case:
$$
L(o) = \int_\Omega L(i)T(p)di\\
T(p) = V(i)\rho (i,o)\max(0, n\cdot i)
$$
The BRDF term $\rho(i,o)$ is dependent to the exiting direction $o$ which may be any value, leading to another 2D function $L(o)$. 
More specifically: for each fixed $o$, we can SH project the light transport part, getting the coefficient $T_i(o)$.
$$
\begin{align}
L(o) & =\int_\Omega(\sum_pl_pB_p(i))(\sum_qT_q(o)B_q(i))di \\
& = \sum_il_iT_i(o)
\end{align}
$$
Then for each $i=0...n$, we SH project $T_i(o)$ to get the final SH projection of $L(o)$, the coefficients of the reflected radiance. 
$$
T_i(o) = \sum_j t_{ij}B_j(o) \\
L(o)=\sum_{i,j}l_it_{ij}B_j(o)
$$
This leads to a vector-matrix multiplication at runtime, resulting $O(n^2)$ computations at both precomputation and runtime.

#### Decomposing Lighting: Another Perspective

$$
T_i = l_i\int_\Omega B_i(i)V(i)\max(o, n\cdot i)di
$$

Take $B_i$ as a part of the environment lighting, and add them together.

**SH: Limitations**
Low frequency
Dynamic lighting but static scenes
Huge precomputational costs

#### More Basis Functions

Wavelet* (All frequencies, pretain only the biggest coefficients for compression, but no fast rorations)
Zonal Harmonics
Sperical Gaussian
Piecewise Constant

### Realtime Global Illumination

[What is] one more indirect bounce?
Any directly lit surface will act as a light source again (*secondary light source* w.r.t. primary light source)

[What is] needed for one bounce indirect illumination?
Get every direct lit surface (the *surface patches*)(1) and their contributions (incident radiance) to each point(2).
(1) Take each pixel as a surface patch, get through shadow map.
(2) The outgoing radiance to eye is known, but we can assume <u>secondary light sources</u> are all lambertian surfaces.

#### Reflective Shadow Maps, RSM

Rendering equation: area-integration form
$$
L_o(p, w_o)=\int_{A_{Patch}}L_i(q\to p)V(p\leftrightarrow q)f(p, q\to p, w_o)\frac{\cos\theta_q \cos\theta_p}{\Vert p-q\Vert}dA
$$
For a specific point $p$, not all pixels $p$ (surface patches) can contribute, due to their visibility $V(p\leftrightarrow q)$, distance $\Vert p-q\Vert$ and orientation $\max(0, \cos\theta_p)\cdot \max(0, \cos\theta_q)$.
We omit the visibiilty term $V(p\leftrightarrow q)$ since it's hard to compute.

**Acceleration**:
All pixels in the shadow map can contribute to $p$. We can decease the number of contributing texels by consider only the nearby texels (nearby in shadow map: 2D neighborhood and similar depth) and sampling.

**Pros:**
Easy implementation (similar to VSM)?
**Cons:**
Linear cost to nLights (Shadow Map)
No visibility check
Too many approximations (distance, diffuse secondary lights, etc.)

**Extra notes:**
RSM is similar to Virtual Point Lights (VPL) in PBR.
RSM is a screen space algorithm, but it has all necessary information in 3D space (i.e. the secondary light sources).
